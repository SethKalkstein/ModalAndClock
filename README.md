# ModalAndClock

For this project you will create two-page project; on your first page you will create page on your choice with one mandatory feature - it must have a modal that appears with delay on the page. On the modal you will have a link that will bring you to the second page where you will build a digital clock.

The hex clock on page 2 is a hex code that reflects the time of day in #hhmmss format in addition to showing the time in hh:mm:ss format. The #hhmmss format is represented by the background color of the screen changing based on the corresponding #hhmmss hex code color which is created by the current time.
